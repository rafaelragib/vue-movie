# movie-application
A pet project of learning Vue 3 and typescript using OMDB API. In this project, I have added features such as:
* Authentication
* Search Movie 
* Persistant watch List that saves users preferences

Check out the application: https://rafaelragib.github.io/vue-movie/
The front-end without the authentication and persistant watchlist can be accesed via the URI given above. 

(username: testuser, password: pass)

**Currently the backend hasn't been deployed.**

~~(To login use username: drew, password: pass)~~

Any sort of issue or improvement is highly appreciated. 

## Tools used in the application 
* Vue 3
* Vue Router
* OMDB Api
* npm
* express
* Language: Typescript
 ## Installation 
To install and run in a local environment, npm needs to be install. ## Project setup
```
npm install
```
and to start the project:

``` 
npm run serve
```
